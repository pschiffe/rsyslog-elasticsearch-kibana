#### MODULES ####

# The imjournal module bellow is now used as a message source instead of imuxsock.
#$ModLoad imjournal # provides access to the systemd journal
#$ModLoad imklog   # provides kernel logging support (previously done by rklogd)
#$ModLoad immark  # provides --MARK-- message capability

# Provides UDP syslog reception
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514

# Provides TCP syslog reception
$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514

# By default, all system logs are read from journald through the
# imjournal module. To read messages from the syslog socket, the
# imuxsock module has to be loaded and a path to the socket specified.
#$ModLoad imuxsock
# The default path to the syslog socket provided by journald:
#$SystemLogSocketName /run/systemd/journal/syslog


#### GLOBAL DIRECTIVES ####

# Where to place auxiliary files
$WorkDirectory /var/lib/rsyslog

# Use default timestamp format
#$ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat

# File syncing capability is disabled by default. This feature is usually not required,
# not useful and an extreme performance hit
#$ActionFileEnableSync on

# Include all config files in /etc/rsyslog.d/
$IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

# File to store the position in the journal
#$IMJournalStateFile imjournal.state
# If there is no saved state yet, don't read in the whole bulk of messages.
# This means some of the older messages won't be collected by rsyslog,
# but it also prevents a potential huge spike in resource utilization.
#$IMJournalIgnorePreviousMessages on
